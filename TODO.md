# Project To-Do List

This program is working and complete, but could benefit from some updates in the future.

1. Improve CSS. Maybe offer a light/dark toggle and make the theme a bit more modern looking?
2. Remove or improve the help menu; it is unattractive and difficult to read.
3. A few more language converters to add: Greek Musical notation, Devanagari
